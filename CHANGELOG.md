- [ ] üö© 2025-01-01 aww tools internal events: I have been considering the current implementation of notifications in aww tools. Currently, it calls `aww::os::actions::show_notification("aww run", "The command finished successfully")`, which runs a bash command in Linux or an API in Windows. One major issue is that this call is synchronous. Additionally, it lacks flexibility, using only one sink: OS messages. This could be an opportunity to test the internal events architecture, introducing a publisher, a type-safe event (not just a string), and subscribers that respond according to the raised event type. Inspired by [LuaCircuitNetwork - Runtime Docs | Factorio](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaCircuitNetwork.html) { lua-api.factorio.com }

OMG, I have remove `aww-tee`



## 2025-07-04 Remove WebView and A-W-A-T Command

`removed` :: `webview`, `aww-tee`

After several integration attempts, I‚Äôve decided to remove the `webview` dependency and the command `aww-tee` , which was heavily reliant on it.

**Why**?

The primary reason is security and control. I realized that communicating between C++ and the WebView using `webview.eval()` and `.bind()`is fundamentally unreliable. The design became increasingly fragile as I attempted to pass messages into the WebView and back out into the C++ application.

I considered setting up an HTTP server for bidirectional communication between C++ and WebView, but that turned out to be too complex ‚Äî and more importantly ‚Äî potentially dangerous. This setup would allow JavaScript running inside WebView to invoke C++ functions, which, given that WebView can load arbitrary external websites, could be exploited maliciously. I didn‚Äôt want to risk any untrusted input (e.g. URLs, injected JS, etc.) eventually bridging into my native code.

Fortunately, technical issues made the communication brittle enough that this pathway didn‚Äôt mature into a stable interface ‚Äî otherwise I might‚Äôve ended up with a subtle security hole.

**Thoughts**

This was not a failure, but a lesson. I‚Äôve tried integrating `webview/webview`into this project a few times now, and while I still think it‚Äôs an incredible project ‚Äî and fun to work with when it‚Äôs the right fit ‚Äî it just doesn‚Äôt belong here *right now*. I‚Äôm going to keep it on my radar for the future, but I‚Äôm hitting pause on this track.

Next steps might involve experimenting with `wxWidgets`, building my own minimal Windows UI layer, or even sticking with a terminal-based UI for now.

**Summary**

- Deleted `webview` from `CMakeLists.txt` and GitHub Actions
- Removed `aww-tee` executable and source files
- Removed routing and tool logic related to `aww-tee`
- Archived the relevant code under `dead_code/` for future reference

This was an interesting and educational experiment ‚Äî I‚Äôm glad I tried it.

  return call_tag_t(_compiletime_hash(str));
}

```

Removed. Reason -- not useful, I will replace it with simpler logging statement.

## 2025-05-10

**Updated (windows) `launch_file` function**: Replaced `ShellExecuteA` with `CreateProcessA` to detach the launched application from the parent console. This prevents the child process from logging errors or warnings into the parent console.

This how it looked before when I opened md file from TUI Far Manager:

## 2025-04-24 üí° graphical launcher for aww suite

When you run the **‚Äúaww‚Äù** command with no parameters and mistype a subcommand, instead of a brief flash and immediate close, the program opens an accessible launcher window and reads aloud or displays the following in sequence:

- A clear spoken or textual announcement of the error, for example ‚ÄúError: subcommand ‚Äòrunn‚Äô not found.‚Äù
- Focus moves to a search field labeled ‚ÄúSearch aww tools.‚Äù As you type, each keystroke is echoed back, and the list of available commands filters in real time.
- A list of all installed aww-tools is presented below the search field. Each entry is announced with its full name and a short description, for example ‚Äúaww-date: copy current date to clipboard,‚Äù ‚Äúaww-guid: generate a UUID,‚Äù ‚Äúaww-tag: apply tags to files,‚Äù and so on.
- Recently used tools are automatically moved to the top and announced as ‚ÄúRecently used.‚Äù
- You navigate the list with the up and down arrow keys; each selection is read aloud. Pressing Enter runs the highlighted tool with the parameters you specify in the same window.
- Tool metadata (names, descriptions, parameters) is sourced from a JSON or Lua configuration file, ensuring new or updated tools are announced immediately without code changes.
- When a tool finishes or reports an error, its output is appended below in a scrollable pane that can be read back or copied, rather than closing the window.

**Considerations:**

- I really like Emacs implemented TUI and GUI in same package, this is so cool
  - 2025-04-25 [ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI: :computer: C++ Functional Terminal User Interface. :heart:](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI) { github.com }
- I probably need to use WxWidgets here, browser integration can be problematic

![img](CHANGELOG.assets/raw.png)

üö© **2025-05-10 Update**: This is kinda funny, how would I implement this without adding confusion?

So I don't want to put all this GUI functionality in `aww.exe` and want to keep it dead simple console app.

This means, `aww.exe` in case it did not find a valid aww tool, should launch the GUI launcher and terminate, passing the control to the child process.

How do I name this GUI launcher? `laww`? (like Love) `waaw` (windows aww) or `awww`? `aww-launch` ? I believe aww launch would be the most confusing, since I already have `aww run` and `aww open` I am considering merging üö© `aww run` and `aww open` together in future.

## 2025-03-29 logging refactor

added `src\aww-spdlog-configuration.hpp` and `init_default_spdlog_configuration` (aww tag #woar96msh50):

```cpp
    init_default_spdlog_configuration("aww-tee");
```

## 2025-03-28 ‚ö†Ô∏è aww-tee won't work that way!

WebView's eval does not work consistently. Using eval is not only unreliable but also insecure. I need to run an HTTP server and use proper web technologies while avoiding bind.

Let's go!

```
#define CPPHTTPLIB_OPENSSL_SUPPORT
#include "path/to/httplib.h"

// HTTP
httplib::Server svr;

// HTTPS
httplib::SSLServer svr;

svr.Get("/hi", [](const httplib::Request &, httplib::Response &res) {
  res.set_content("Hello World!", "text/plain");
});

svr.listen("0.0.0.0", 8080);
```

üö© SSL support is available with `CPPHTTPLIB_OPENSSL_SUPPORT`. `libssl` and `libcrypto` should be linked.

## 2025-03-23 aww tag

Added option for espanso integration

```sh
aww tag --aww-no-side-effects
```

## 2025-03-23 aww-tee is not fixed!

I think I have some multithreading issue with aww tee. The command

```sh
tree | aww tee
```

produces nothing in the Html output. pollLogs seems not to be working.

At point... ah... I have decided to merge `include` and `src` folder... won't help to solve the aww tee issue, but I wanted to do it for a long time.

Removed many many files from `third-party` and replaced them with

```cmake
## nlohmann_json

    json
    URL https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.3/json.tar.xz

```

## 2025-03-18 aww-tee fixed

Good test command on Windows:

```sh
ping -t 127.0.0.1
```

```
ping -t 127.0.0.1 | aww tee
```

works correct in cmd. Has some issue with powershell, but it finally works!

![image-20250318215024085](CHANGELOG.assets/image-20250318215024085.png)

I had to switch from pushing messages with `w.eval` to rather poll messages from javascript with `pollNewLogs`

`w.eval` does not work. The current implementation is better, because it let's browser control the log rendering in more usual way.

## 2025-03-18 webview in aww-tee

I have really stuck at this loop, don't know why eval seems not to be working, what is wrong? How do I pass data to webview?

I can call `window.notifyReady()` from debug console, but not from `eval` üö©

```cpp
    std::thread ready_thread([&w, &webview_ready]() {
      spdlog::info("#mtshvdvxg6k check webview_ready started");
      while (!webview_ready.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
        try {
          // Call the bound notifyReady function.
          spdlog::info("#6cb1fx9g2p5 attempt to call window.notifyReady();");
          // w.eval("if (typeof window.notifyReady === 'function') { window.notifyReady(); }");
          // AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
          w.eval("window.notifyReady();");
        } catch (const std::exception& e) {
          spdlog::debug("notifyReady call error: {}", e.what());
        }
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
      }
    });

```

## 2025-03-16 aww-tee

`aww-tee` is a tool designed to display logs. It outputs logs to the console and also streams them to a browser window. The idea is to use the browser for better log searching and filtering. In some cases, when another application runs a command, the output is hidden, so you can't tell if something is happening or if there's an error. `aww-tee` helps by showing this information clearly.

It's also difficult to select and copy logs from the console without disrupting the running process, especially since using Ctrl+C can interrupt things. `aww-tee` aims to make copying logs easier.

## 2025-01-19 Sun

Implemented `aww stuff cat` (cat_command) -- reads file and writes content to stdout:

mostly to test new `aww::result<T>` from awwlib (aww tag #jyjhwmmy084)

## 2025-01-09 Thu

Added new functionality to `aww-stuff`:

- `save-clipboard-to-file`: Saves the current clipboard text to a file.
- `set-clipboard-from-file <file_name>`: Sets the clipboard text from the specified file.

The interesting research question is if I need to do anything special for handling UTF-8 text? The only issue I see right now is incorrect console output on windows, because console is not UTF-8 by default. This can be fixed by setting the console to UTF-8 mode:

```sh
chcp 65001
```

Once it is set, the console will display UTF-8 characters correctly. Even this ones:

> –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç üåç „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ

![image-20250109170426133](CHANGELOG.assets/image-20250109170426133.png)

Replaced `deps.show_notification` calls with `spdlog` logging calls for better logging and error handling.

## 2025-01-08 Wed

Added new tool `aww-stuff` to simplify integration testing and experiments with external APIs.

## 2025-01-03 Fri

Oh, cool! Reduced copy pasta in aww-run.

Created new function

```cpp
std::vector<fs::path> get_script_search_locations(std::string scriptName,
                                                  const script_search_locations& searchLocations,
                                                  const script_extensions& extensions) {
```

Which considers all possible locations for script (not that many) and returns list of candidates.

Started experiment with value objects:

```cpp
struct script_search_locations {
  std::vector<fs::path> values;

  explicit script_search_locations(std::initializer_list<fs::path> paths) {
    for (const auto& path : paths) {
      values.emplace_back(path);
    }
  }
};

struct script_extensions {
  std::vector<std::string> values;

  // Constructor accepting initializer list of strings
  explicit script_extensions(std::initializer_list<std::string> extensions) {
    for (const auto& extension : extensions) {
      values.emplace_back(extension);
    }
  }
};
```

Look stylish when initialized:

```cpp
  const fs::path currentDir = fs::absolute(fs::current_path());
  const fs::path awwScriptsDir = currentDir / "aww-scripts";
  const fs::path awwDotScriptsDir = aww::os::env::get_aww_dot_dir() / "aww-scripts";
  const fs::path awwDir = currentDir / "aww";

  const script_search_locations searchLocations{currentDir, awwScriptsDir, awwDotScriptsDir,
                                                awwDir};
```

- [ ] üö© try to fix the aww term bug on ubuntu with no terminal, instead call the `/bin/env bash`
- [ ] üö© Why do I need aww::os::can_execute ????

## 2024-12-25 Implement lua arg in aww run

- [x] Implement Lua arg support 2024-12-26 [interactive lua: command line arguments - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2945819/interactive-lua-command-line-arguments) {stackoverflow.com}. See **./lua-samples/argy.lua**

So, no this script works:

```lua
print("ARGUMENTS!")
for i,v in ipairs(arg) do
    print("Argument " .. i .. ": " .. v)
end
```

Implementation:

```cpp
      // Populate Lua's 'arg' table with command-line arguments
      lua_newtable(L); // Create a new table

      // add the script path as the first argument
      constexpr int LUA_TABLE_INDEX = -3; // Index of the table in the Lua stack
      lua_Number luaCmdIndex = 1;
      lua_pushnumber(L, luaCmdIndex);
      lua_pushstring(L, scriptPath.string().c_str());
      lua_settable(L, LUA_TABLE_INDEX);

      // starts from 1 because the first argument is the script path which is already added
      for (size_t i = 1; i < mutableCmdArgs.size(); ++i) {
        luaCmdIndex += 1.0;
        lua_pushnumber(L, luaCmdIndex);               // Push the index (Lua uses 1-based indexing)
        lua_pushstring(L, mutableCmdArgs[i].c_str()); // Push the argument string
        lua_settable(L, LUA_TABLE_INDEX);             // Set table[arg_index] = arg_value
      }
      lua_setglobal(L, "arg"); // Set the table as the global 'arg'

```

I have also modified the script in LUA TODO -- luatext.lua

The change is: lua scripts will use global table `arg` instead of any custom ones.

üü† The Lua `arg[1]` will always be the full and absolute path to the current script. I was confused when I discovered that in C++, the value of `argv[0]` depends on the operating system and is generally not reliable.

## 2024-11-07 Thu

Despite the number of changes in this pull request and the many files modified, most of this is due to the introduction of a new styling format with `clang-format`. I reformatted a lot of files, fixed some bugs (which I don't fully recall), and made a major change by working to migrate and extract library functions from `awwlib` into a separate repository also named `awwlib`.

The plan moving forward is to integrate Lua as the language for configuration and scripting, with support for `aww-run`. To proceed with these next steps, I need to merge these changes now and start with a clean slate.

## 2024-10-27 Sun

I wanted to test if I can apply "Curiously recurring template pattern (CRTP)" instead of using virtual polymorphism.

CRTP offers compile time polymorphism, which, I suppose can be faster, but it requires some hacks.

And the main hack, is that instead of this in the interface declaration:

```cpp
int aww_date_main(const std::vector<std::string>& cmdArgs,
                  aww_date_io_dependencies_interface& deps);
}
```

I would need to do this:

```cpp
int aww_date_main(const std::vector<std::string>& cmdArgs,
                  auto& deps);
}
```

which makes the interface ambiguous for the reader. I really want to declare that the tool needs `aww_date_io_dependencies_interface&`.

Update: Oh, I found this, so the problematic `auto` code can be expressed as:

```cpp
template<typename T>
int aww_date_main(const std::vector<std::string>& cmdArgs,
                  aww_date_io_dependencies_interface<T>& deps);
}
```

I might return back to this note and reconsider CRTP

Returned webview!

Working on integration with:

2024-03-10 [libcpr/cpr: C++ Requests: Curl for People, a spiritual port of Python Requests.](https://github.com/libcpr/cpr)

With some compilation issues / dll sharing issues.

## 2024-01-27

Code cleanup:

I've removed the [webview/webview](https://github.com/webview/webview) dependency, a tiny cross-platform webview library for C/C++ using WebKit and Edge WebView2. While it's an awesome tool for building cross-platform browser GUIs, I couldn't find a suitable application for it in the awwtools project. It might be better suited for a standalone project.

## 2024-01-19

Tiny update to CXX 20. No issues so far.

## 2023-12-10

My most used and most simple aww tool `aww-date` got some experimental update.

I have found that tracking the input/output dependencies calls is tricky, since, for instance, `fs_file_exists()`

can be called multiple times in the code for different cases. In the test cases, I want to somehow recreate the complex code path, but

tracking the right calls by their call order (number of times same function was called) or by the input parameters is too brittle, how can I precisely find the call I need? at first, for a long time, my idea was to rename `fs_file_exists()` to a case specific name, like:

- if `fs_template_folder_exists()`
  - if `fs_template_file_exists()`
    - do something
  - else if `fs_template_file_with_specification_exists()`
    - do something else

but to support this case I have to:

- add these function to `aww_create_io_dependencies_interface`
- then implement in `aww_create_io_dependencies`
- then create a mock in `aww_create_io_dependencies_stub`

This simple does not scale, so I have decided to tag these calls at compile time and keep the generic name.

New code added:

`include\aww-common.hpp`

```cpp
// CallTag struct definition
struct call_tag_t {
constexpr explicit call_tag_t(unsigned long long value) : value(value) {}

const unsigned long long value;
};

// Compile-time hash function
constexpr unsigned long long _compiletime_hash(const char* str, unsigned long long hash = 0, size_t index = 0) {
return str[index] ? _compiletime_hash(str, (hash * 131) + str[index], index + 1) : hash;
}

// call_tag function with compile-time length check for string literals
template <size_t N>
constexpr call_tag_t call_tag(const char (&str)[N]) {
  static_assert(N > 11, "Tag string must be at least 11 characters long."); // N includes the null terminator
  return call_tag_t(_compiletime_hash(str));
}
```

Usage at `src\internal\aww-date.cpp`

```cpp
if (deps.clipboard_set_text(result, aww::call_tag("t7svmrrhai0"))) {
    std::cout << "Copied to clipboard: " << result << "\n";
    deps.show_notification("aww date", "The date has been copied to the clipboard", aww::call_tag("tssis4p5ta2"));
} else {
    std::cout << "Failed to copy to clipboard: " << result << "\n";
    deps.show_notification("aww date", "Failed to copy the date to the clipboard", aww::call_tag("730v5jc2d3o"));
    return 1;
}
```

### aww git open

My current unit-testing strategy feels overwhelming:

Dependency:

- Interface, implementation
- Test implementation, manual stubs

It requires some time and discipline, but it seems to be working.

For instance, now I can write unit-tests or experiment by replacing parts of the

tool with something new and keep the previous implementation for other tools.

The Dependency patterns gives me this flexibility.

Today, I have hopefully replaces all dependencies in `aww-git-open`

### aww guid

I have designed an new prompt to assist me with stub generation for unit-tests, here it is:

#### GPT Prompt

When I say a command !implement: followed by function signature, I want you to write the implementation for the C++ function.
Do not put any extra boilerplate code (like class definitions), just give me the implementation close to the example below.
Example, my request:

```
!implement:
virtual inline aww::Result launch_file_in_browser(const std::string &url) = 0;
```

Your response:
file `io_dependencies_interface`:

```cpp
        /**
         * Launch a file in the default browser.
         * @param url The url to launch.
         * @return Aww::Result indicating the success or failure of the operation.
         */
        virtual inline aww::Result launch_file_in_browser(const std::string &url) = 0;
```

file `io_dependencies`:

```cpp
        inline aww::Result launch_file_in_browser(const std::string &url) override
        {
          // TODO: implement me
        }
```

file `io_dependencies_stub`:

```cpp
        // always define a default stub function (do not put this comment in the resulting code)
        std::function<aww::Result(const std::string&)>
            launch_file_in_browser_stub = [this]([[maybe_unused]]const std::string &url) -> aww::Result
        {
            return aww::Result::ok();
        };
        // always define a counter (do not put this comment in the resulting code)
        int launch_file_in_browser_called = 0;

        // always call the stub function and increment the call counter (do not put this comment in the resulting code)
        aww::Result launch_file_in_browser(const std::string &url) override
        {
            launch_file_in_browser_called += 1;
            return launch_file_in_browser_stub(url);
        }
```

Also [dot-awwtools/aww-scripts/mdtree.ps1 at main ¬∑ dzharii/dot-awwtools ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/dzharii/dot-awwtools/blob/main/aww-scripts/mdtree.ps1) helps a lot for setting GPT context and asking it to generate tests.

```
aww run mdtree -FilterName ".*aww-guid.*"
```

### And the unit-testing prompt worked well

I want you to be an expert developer in Test in modern C++ language who:

- writes solid and simple-to-understand unit-test for C++ projects
- uses doctest/doctest.h library for unit-testing
- prioritizes the most important tests to cover the most important code first
- writes bug-free and elegant code.

In my next message, I will give you a task; before providing your answer with the code,
brainstorm it internally:

- find and fix possible bugs
- make code organization more elegant
- ensure the code is testable and advice how to improve testability
- ensure there are no security vulnerabilities.

Codding style:

- for unused parameters use `[[maybe_unused]]` attribute

Attempt to fix the issues from discovered in the brainstorm and only then provide the answer to my request.
Say "Ack" to acknowledge or ask me any questions that may improve your response.
And then wait for my next request with the task for you.

## 2023-06-30

- Tiny refactoring for aww-git-open. Ready for making unit-tests.

## 2023-06-22

The error handling aww::Result code for I/O operations is too verbose and complex.
I've decided to revert some code to use std::filesystem functions instead and added
global error handler.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  try
  {
    std::vector<std::string> cmdArgs(argv, argv + argc);
    cmdArgs.erase(cmdArgs.begin()); // remove first element

    aww::internal::aww_create::aww_create_io_dependencies deps;
    return aww::internal::aww_create::aww_create_main(cmdArgs, deps);
  }
  catch (std::exception &ex)
  {
    std::cerr << ex.what() << "\n";
    return 1;
  }
  catch (...)
  {
    std::cerr << "Caught unknown exception.\n";
    return 1;
  }
```

The exception situation is truly should be !! exceptional !!, so I'd rather handle I/O error in the
global handler.

## 2023-06-19

The idea about returning aw::Result from each I/O operation adds lots of ugly error handling code.

nope, maybe some global try/cath will be better.
Maybe I should whitch back to std::\* io opearions.

```
    fs::path currentDir;
    if (aww::Result res = deps.fs_get_current_directory_absolute_path(currentDir); res.is_failed())
    {
      std::cout << "Failed to get current directory"
                << res.error()
                << "\n";
      return 1;
    }

```

aww::Result improving experiment

2023-06-20 [if statement - cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/if)

```cpp
    if (aww::Result res = deps.fs_get_current_directory_absolute_path(currentDir); res.is_failed())
    {
      std::cout << "Failed to get current directory"
                << res.error()
                << "\n";
      return 1;
    }
```

## 2023-06-17

- `aww_git_open` started refactoring to extract I/O dependencies

## 2023-06-08

- Refactor / move from `aww create` to `awwlib`
  - `aww::fs::` file_or_dir_exists, create_directories,
  - Rename camel case to snake case

## 2023-06-07

- Use `aww-run-aww` for custom cmd, sh and ps1 scripts

## 2023-06-05

- The Great Unit testing refactoring
- Introduced dependency pattern for input/output dependencies.
- refactored `aww date` and `aww create` to use dependency injection and covered
  the utils with unit-tests.
- `CPP_HEADER_FILE_NAME` renamed to `CAPITALIZED_FILE_NAME`
  This is important milestone to make code more stable and perform less manual adhoc tests.

## 2023-05-01

- fixed bug in aww run when failed command was reported as failed and then successful. O_O
- wintoastlib -- removed debug output

## 2023-04-16

`aww.cpp` now provides a static definition of the tool list and passes arguments directly to the tool's `main()` function using `const std::vector<std::string> &cmdArgs`. This change eliminates the need to check for the existence of `aww-tool.exe` using the filesystem and replaces the previous flow of reading arguments, serializing them as a string, and passing them to the `system()` call. Now, arguments are passed directly to the tool's main function as shown in the example below:
Before:

```
aww tool-name => read args => serialize args back as string => find-if aww-tool exists => pass args as a string via system(...) call.
```

After:

```
aww date one two three => aww::internal::aww_date::aww_date_main(awwExecutableArgs)
```

These changes result in a more efficient and streamlined workflow for using the aww tools.

## 2023-04-10

- add more `aww create` templates for powershell cmd and sh companions

## 2023-03-27

- fixed bug in `aww create` : `CPP_HEADER_FILE_NAME` to generate valid identifiers.

the commands:

```sh
aww create .\include\internal\aww-xyz.hpp
aww create .\src\internal\aww-xyz.cpp
```

were very helpful during migration to lib.

## 2021-03-26

Migrated to library:

- `aww-create.cpp`
- `aww-git-open.cpp`
- `aww-guid.cpp`
- ... and all others

## 2023-03-24

Changelog created!
`aww create` now creates folders when the file name does not have an extension. This makes it impossible to create extension-less files, but for the sake of simplicity -- it is what it is.

`aww date` -- converted to use `main` implementation from lib.
