# aww-tools changelog


## 2023-03-24

Changelog created! 
`aww create` now creates folders when the file name does not have an extension. This makes it impossible to create extension-less files, but for the sake of simplicity -- it is what it is.  

`aww date` -- converted to use `main` implementation from lib.
