# Aww APP
Date: 2023-07-04

2023-07-04 aww app: final thoughts:

aww app should a user interface, that can be configured to run bash or powershell scripts. 
aww app can perform basic operations, like:
 - capturing and dispalaying the propgram output and errors
 - passing arguments to the script
 - execure scrript in a batch

but aww-app should be restircted to the specific working folder
the actions must be initiated by the user. 

before executing script, aww app sets the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE aww-app=1
Think about aww-app as an advanced browser based console.
