# Aww App Ideas 

## Web bookmark application
A simple window where the user can drag n drop or copy/paste links. 
The app will store when the link was added and collect some related information, like the page title. Store the link on the hard drive, maybe in SQLite. 
The app allows export in HTML or Markdown. 

## aww hello world 
Creates as simple file based on template. 
For instance, 
aww hello world main.cpp will create main.cpp with sample hello world code.

## aww app org
Simple organizer. Keep your promises, chats, quotes, todos

## aww app comm
Communication templates
See also `aww-comm.templates.md`

## aww app markdown
markdown utility

## aww (app) help

## Html form + powershell script.
So I want to run a powershell script via webui. This is probably going to be the main 
feature: to run script and get the output.

What should I do?
- Define form with the input parameters:
  I can take [HTML::FormFu - HTML Form Creation, Rendering and Validation Framework - metacpan.org](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTML::FormFu) for the inspiration
- Run script and get the output. Maybe in realtime (That would be cool)
- Maybe I need to support a collection of scripts?

## aww open, aww term
