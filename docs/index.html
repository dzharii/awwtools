  <h1>Ù©(âŠ™â€¿âŠ™)Û¶ Aww Tools</h1>
  <p>A collection of productivity tools</p>
  <p>Embrace the aww!</p>

  <h2>We have
    <span class="zoo-zoom">such sights</span> to show you!</h2>
  <p>
    But, don't get your hopes too high. How many times have you found a simple code snippet that was helpful?
    Aww tools aim to collect such snippets and make them handy and easy to use when you need them.
    Most of aww tools are very simple and minimalist projects. For example, you may need a new GUID once in a while...
    not very oftenâ€¦ but when you do, <b>aww guid</b> is there for you!
  </p>
  <p>
    Want to know how it was implemented on Windows, Linux, and Mac?
  </p>
  <p>
    Ha-ha. Spoiler alert! It was a mix of pain and pleasure!
    Please, enjoy aww tools as a bunch of useful and fun samples, and don't expect too much ;)
  </p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>One of the core ideas of aww tools is to make the contribution process as convenient as possible. This is why aww tools are distributed as a git repo. You are encouraged to open the github repository and fork the project: </p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/dzharii/awwtools">https://github.com/dzharii/awwtools</a></p>

  <p> Or you can postpone this decision and clone it now. I do not insist on forking. Just a suggestion ;) </p>

<pre><code>
git clone https://github.com/dzharii/awwtools
</code></pre>

<p>âœ¨ Wow! Thank you for making this first step!</p>
<p>As Lao Tsu says "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."</p>

<p>Next, let's get to the awwtools repo folder. You can do it! </p>

<p>And... let's make sure we have all dependencies installed</p>

<h3>CMake</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://cmake.org/install/">Installing CMake</a> on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
</p>
<p>
  CMake alternative Windows 11:
</p>
<pre><code>
winget install -e --id Kitware.CMake
</code></pre>

<h3>C++ compiler</h3>

<h4>On Windows</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/"></a> Visual Studio Community</a> would be the best choice.
  Please, enable C++ support during installation.
</p>

<h4>On GNU/Linux</h4>
<p>You can use GCC</p>

<h4>On MacOS</h4>
<p>Not supported, cuz I do not have a Mac.</p>
<p>
  I've tried <a href="https://www.darlinghq.org/">Darling</a> (translation layer that lets you run macOS software on Linux);
</p>
<p>
  But, unfortunately, its xcode (v9) is too outdated to compile awwtools.(problem with #include &lt;filesystem&gt;) :(
</p>
<p>
  Meaning... I am still planning to support clang, and theoretical ways to get things done on Mac...
  but since I do not have an easy way to test it on Mac.. this is all only theoretical for now. No guarantees.
</p>

<hr />

<p>I really appreciate you are still here after all these installations</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

"Materialize" the build system with CMake
<pre><code>
cmake . -B cmake-build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
cmake --build cmake-build
</code></pre>

<h2>Aww tools!</h2>

<h3>aww git open</h2>
<pre><code>
aww git open
aww-git-open
aww git open [optional file or folder path]
aww-git-open [optional file or folder path]
</code></pre>

<p>
  Source code: <a href="https://github.com/dzharii/awwtools/blob/main/app/aww-git-open.cpp">/main/app/aww-git-open.cpp</a>
</p>

<p>
  This tool is useful when you want to share a link to the source file with your friend... or a ðŸ§›colleague.
</p>

<p>
  Opens the default system browser with the web version of the provided file or folder.
  The file path is optional and, when launched without parameters -- attempts to open the current directory.
</p>

<h3>aww date</h2>
<pre><code>
# returns current date as YYYY-MM-DD:
aww date
aww-date

# returns safe file name string with date
aww date [optional text]
aww-date [optional text]

# example:
aww date letter to my future self
# result
# 2022-10-24-letter-to-my-future-self (result is copied to clipboard)
</code></pre>

<p>
Source code: <a href="https://github.com/dzharii/awwtools/blob/main/app/aww-date.cpp">/main/app/aww-date.cpp</a>
</p>

<p>
This tool copies the current date to the clipboard. It is useful when you want to create a file with a date in the name.
</p>
<p>
If any text is provided as a command line argument, it will be appended to the date.
The unsafe filename characters will be replaced with "-".
</p>

<h3>aww toast</h2>
<pre><code>
aww toast [message]
aww toast Hello, World!

# example:
sudo apt-get install -y cowsay && aww toast Installed! || aww toast Installation failed!
# result
# This example shows a desktop notification after command apt-get finishes the installation (or fails).
</code></pre>

<p>
  Source code: <a href="https://github.com/dzharii/awwtools/blob/main/app/aww-toast.cpp">/main/app/aww-toast.cpp</a>
</p>

<p>
  Shows a simple operating system "toast" notification with the message provided as the command line arguments.
</p>

<h3>aww run</h2>
<pre><code>
aww run [command line]

# example:
aww run ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mp4
aww-run ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>
  Source code: <a href="https://github.com/dzharii/awwtools/blob/main/app/aww-run.cpp">/main/app/aww-run.cpp</a>
</p>

<p>
  Wraps input command line and executes it as a child process. Echoes command line output and shows a notification when the command has finished. Measures execution time.
</p>

<h2>Q&A</h2>

<h3>Q: Why C++?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>FOR THE GLORY!!!</p>
  <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> had been released in 1985, the year before I was born...
  And it is OLD, like me, but not OBSOLETE! (ðŸ¤–)</p>
  <p>
    In this project, we definitely do not take performance into the consideration. But look! In aw tools we don't have to
    manually manage the memory allocations; but we have this option, he-he!
  </p>
