# The Plan



## User configuration

- [ ] Should definitely support  dot files, like `.awwtools` but also would be great to support a separate git repository for the configuration, like `my-awwtools`. The  awwtools can provide commands to manage configuration, like `aww config push` `aww config pull`

## The Tools

### Git

- `aww git push`
- `aww git open`
- `aww git help`



## Cheat sheets

- would be great to have cheat sheets for the commonly used tools
