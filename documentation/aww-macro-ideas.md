# 💡 aww macro ideas

I was really inspired by how Emacs handles editing commands. Emacs, like Vim, maps every cursor movement or editing operation to a command. Each of these commands can be invoked programmatically, and the user can compose them into interactive macros. That concept—that the entire editor is scriptable—was a huge inspiration for me.

I realized that sometimes I just want a higher-level, more expressive editing experience when I’m generating files or modifying text in C# or PowerShell. In PowerShell, for example, I typically have to fall back to plain string operations: read the file line by line, find the line I care about, then manually insert a block before or after it, handle JSON parsing separately, and so on. There’s not much abstraction unless I build my own.

So I started looking into macro automation—basically ways to script editing buffers the way Emacs does it: with a concept of a “point,” buffer navigation commands like `search-forward`, `beginning-of-buffer`, etc., and pure scriptable interactions.

### file-editor (Rust)

The first project I found was [`file-editor`](https://crates.io/crates/file-editor), a minimalistic, zero-dependency file editing library written in Rust. It doesn’t maintain buffer state the way Emacs does, but it exposes a clean API for common operations like appending, inserting, and replacing. Here’s an example:

```rust
use file_editor::Editor;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    Editor::open("config.txt")?
        .insert_before("## SETTINGS", "max_retries = 5\n", true)
        .replace("DEBUG=false", "DEBUG=true")
        .append("\n# EOF")
        .save()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The API is ergonomic, chaining operations like `insert_before`, `replace`, `append`, and calling `save()` when done. It’s great for generating boilerplate or transforming structured files.

### texted (Go)

Then I found [`texted`](https://github.com/dhamidi/texted), and this was exactly what I was looking for. It’s written in Go but acts like a headless Emacs for the terminal. It supports a limited set of Emacs-style editing commands that can be composed in scripts. You can pass a script via command line, either as a simple DSL or as Lisp-style S-expressions.

For example, this is a one-liner that finds and replaces "TODO" with "DONE" in-place:

```sh
texted edit -i notes.txt -s 'search-forward "TODO"; replace-match "DONE"'
```

Or using the S-expression mode:

```sh
texted edit --sexp -i notes.txt -s '(beginning-of-buffer) (search-forward "TODO") (replace-match "DONE")'
```

This is what I was imagining when thinking about a programmable macro system. You can also write more advanced macros as standalone scripts and invoke them as part of a shell pipeline. It works similarly to `jq` or `awk`, but with a more structured approach that feels like Emacs scripting in a CLI context.

### Where This Leads

I haven’t tried extending `texted` yet, but I’m thinking about how to bring some of that programmable editor concept into C++ or PowerShell environments. Ideally, I’d have a small editing engine—like `texted`—but native to my toolchain. It would operate on a virtual buffer, be fully scriptable, and expose composable edit commands. That could enable all sorts of automation for file generation, config templating, or even LLM-driven refactoring.

For now, `file-editor` and `texted` are two strong reference points: one minimal and Rust-native, the other more expressive and Emacs-inspired. I'm going to explore how far I can push that idea in my own stack.

## texted

The **texted** project offers a headless, scriptable text editor designed for automated file editing via command-line interfaces. It implements a minimal, non-Turing-complete Lisp dialect—**edlisp**—to drive text transformations, thereby combining the simplicity of **sed** with the extensibility of **Emacs**-style editing without pulling in complex dependencies. The tool is implemented in Go, distributed as a single binary, and targets workflows where reproducible, idempotent edits to UTF-8 files are required, such as generated code maintenance, bulk configuration updates, or AI-driven editing pipelines.

## Motivation and Context

Automated text manipulation sits at the core of modern DevOps and continuous integration workflows. Traditional Unix utilities like **sed** or **awk** excel at simple pattern replacements but become unwieldy when stateful or multi-step changes are needed. Conversely, fully featured editors expose rich scripting APIs (e.g., Emacs Lisp), but require interactive environments and heavy dependencies. **texted** fills this gap by offering:

- A scriptable editor that can run non-interactively over stdin/stdout or via in-place file edits
- A deliberately minimal Lisp interpreter supporting only essential editing primitives
- An extensible test harness via XML-based test definitions to validate transformation scripts

This design empowers both shell scripts and large language models to execute coherent, multi-step editing operations with simple S-expression syntax, while retaining predictability and auditability.

## Architecture and Core Components

**texted** includes four primary components:

1. **Command-line Interface**
    The `texted` binary accepts subcommands such as `edit`, which orchestrate buffer loading, script evaluation, and file writing.
2. **Buffer Abstraction**
    The editor loads file contents into an in-memory buffer of lines. Primitive functions operate on this buffer.
3. **edlisp Interpreter**
    A minimalist Lisp evaluator supports function application, symbol resolution, strings, and numbers. It intentionally excludes general control flow constructs.
4. **Testing Framework**
    XML-based test cases define the initial buffer, script input, expected output, and errors. This enables regression safety and CI integration.

## Installation and Setup

Install **texted** using Go (1.19+):

```sh
go install github.com/dhamidi/texted/cmd/texted@latest
```

This installs `texted` to your `GOPATH/bin` or `GOBIN`. The binary is standalone and needs no additional setup.

## Quick Start Examples

### Replace a Word in a Stream

```sh
echo "hello world" \
| texted edit \
    -s 'search-forward "world"; replace-match "universe"'
# Output: hello universe
```

### In-Place File Editing

```sh
texted edit \
    -s 'search-forward "TODO"; replace-match "DONE"' \
    -i src/*.go
```

### Using S-Expression Syntax

```sh
texted edit --sexp \
    -s '(search-forward "pattern")' \
    file.txt
```

## Editing Primitives in edlisp

Key functions include:

- `search-forward "str"`: move cursor to first match
- `replace-match "str"`: replace matched region
- `insert "str"`: insert text at cursor
- `delete-region start end`: delete text between line numbers
- `beginning-of-buffer`, `end-of-buffer`
- `next-line`, `previous-line`

Scripts are written sequentially and interpreted without loops, allowing host shells to control iteration.

## Custom Go Functions

Extend **texted** by registering functions in Go:

```go
env.Functions["upper-case-line"] = func(args []edlisp.Value, buf *edlisp.Buffer) (edlisp.Value, error) {
    line := buf.Lines[buf.Cursor]
    buf.Lines[buf.Cursor] = strings.ToUpper(line)
    return edlisp.NewString(""), nil
}
```

This transforms the current line to uppercase. Such hooks can deeply customize behavior.

## XML-Based Testing

Sample test structure:

```xml
<test>
  <buffer>initial content</buffer>
  <input lang="shell">search-forward "foo"; replace-match "bar"</input>
  <output>expected content</output>
</test>
```

This supports automated testing via `go test`, integrating with CI pipelines.

## HTTP Integration Example

Basic HTTP server exposing `/edit`:

```go
package main

import (
  "net/http"
  "github.com/dhamidi/texted/tools"
)

func main() {
  http.HandleFunc("/edit", tools.EditFileHandler)
  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

Clients POST scripts and files to `/edit` to perform edits remotely.

## Testing and Continuous Integration

CI pipeline includes:

- Formatting via `go fmt`
- Static checks via `go vet`
- Unit and XML regression tests via `go test`
- GitHub Actions for pull request validation

## Roadmap

Planned features:

- Conditional constructs like `if`, `when`
- Optional regex support
- Undo/redo support for interactive modes
- Interactive REPL for scripting exploration

## Conclusion

**texted** provides a focused, efficient solution for programmatic file edits. Its minimalist Lisp scripting, fast Go runtime, and clean command-line interface make it ideal for CI, code generation, shell automation, and LLM-integrated tools. With robust testing and extensibility, it bridges the gap between Unix text tools and programmable editors.



## file-editor

The **file-editor** crate provides a streamlined, zero-dependency API for creating, modifying, and querying UTF-8 text files in Rust. It targets Rust edition 2024 and requires Rust 1.85 or newer. By returning a mutable reference to itself from every mutating method, it enables method chaining, which encourages concise, expressive workflows for text manipulation. Whether truncating existing files, appending or prepending content, inserting blocks around markers, or performing global replacements, file-editor offers a consistent, ergonomic interface that covers most common file-editing needs without pulling in unnecessary dependencies.

## Motivation and Context

Text files remain a fundamental data interchange format in software development, configuration, and data processing. Traditional Rust approaches often involve reading a file into a `String`, manually manipulating the buffer, and writing back to disk, which can lead to duplicated boilerplate and error-prone code. **file-editor** addresses these pain points by encapsulating file I/O, buffering, and editing operations behind a single `Editor` type. It relieves developers from writing repetitive setup and teardown logic, reduces the risk of forgetting to flush buffers, and centralizes editing semantics into a coherent API.

## Core API Overview

At the heart of the crate is the `Editor` struct. You can create a new file (or truncate an existing one) using `Editor::create(path)`, or open an existing file with `Editor::open(path)`. After performing a series of chained operations—such as `.append(text)`, `.prepend(text)`, `.insert_before(marker, block, same_indent)`, `.replace(old, new)`, or `.erase(pattern)`—you call `.save()?` to flush changes to disk. All methods that alter the buffer return `&mut self`, enabling fluent composition. A companion `.rename(new_path)` method handles on-disk renames while updating the internal path.

## Opt-in Regex Support

By default, file-editor has no external dependencies. For use cases requiring pattern matching with regular expressions, the crate provides an optional `"regex"` feature. When enabled in `Cargo.toml`, methods like `.mask(&re, replacement)` and `.replace_regex(&re, replacement)` accept a compiled `regex::Regex`, allowing redaction or substitution based on complex patterns. This opt-in design preserves minimal dependency footprints for simple scenarios while offering advanced text processing when needed.

| Erase / Replace / Mask | `erase`, `replace`, `mask`           | Operate on all occurrences in the buffer          |
| Save                   | `save`                               | Writes only when the buffer is dirty              |
| Advanced (regex)       | pattern-based methods (`mask`, etc.) | Requires enabling `regex` feature in `Cargo.toml` |

This table reflects the crate’s balanced coverage of common file operations with extensibility points for advanced patterns.

## Example Usage

Below is a typical editing workflow. It demonstrates creation of a new file, insertion of a header, block insertion, a textual replacement, and saving:

```rust
use file_editor::Editor;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    Editor::create("notes.txt")?               // new (or truncate existing)
        .append("Rust is fun\n")
        .prepend("# My Notes\n")
        .insert_after("# My Notes", "========\n", true)
        .replace("fun", "blazingly fast")
        .save()?;                              // explicit flush to disk
    Ok(())
}
```
